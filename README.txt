== Description ==

This is a Lob Pong game. The goal of the player is to keep the ball from falling for as long as possible. This game consists of three levels, where each is a little bit harder. So in the second level the platform is a little bit smaller and the ball is faster. In the last level the platform is even smaller and the ball faster. Each level lasts 60 seconds and the player has three lives for each level. Each time the player loses a life, his or her score is lowered by 5. Each second the game is played, the player gains 1 point.
== Gameplay ==

*  Move the platform with the A & D key respectively left or right.
*  Notice that the ball bounces off of the walls.
*  Once the time for one level reaches 0, the next level will start after 1 second.
*  The ball will get less and less high after hitting the walls.
*  After the player loses all of his or her lives, or finishes the last level, a game over screen with the final score appears

== Extra Information ==
*  3 Levels where the difficulty increases
*  Whenever ball bounces off of something it loses some of itâ€™s y-speed. (More realistic)
